# Zylo

## Introduction
Zylo represents the collection of many modern medical technologies. These medical technologies can help determine the probability of gaining diseases, or help forecast other medical interactios. While still in development Zylo is showing promising results in both training and testing data. This modern technology can be applied to both scientific discoveries, and medical automation. (NOTE: While Zylo is a powerful model demonstrating reliability in testing data, it is not fully precise and can make mistakes, always consult a professional before making any decisions)

## How it Works
Zylo solves many medical problems, due to that, Zylo utilizes many different algorithms each specified to address the specific area. However, all algorithms Zylo uses share one common feature; a feedforward architecture. A feedforwad neural network leverages differential calculus and matrix operations to learn and make quick automated predictions. Particularly, the network forward propagates values through initialised parameters, then this generates an output, this output is then compared to the correct confidences creating a loss. Finally, this loss is backward propagated through the network updating the parameters, these new parameters now generate more precise outputs with a lower loss. After this process is repeated for many variations of the data, the network learns. (NOTE: This is a very simple explanation of the feedforward architecture, and is also a very simple explanation of the general model. If you want to further understand how it works we have research papers available)


## Conclusion
In conclusion, Zylo leverages many ground-breaking technologies in order to segregate, classify, and predict many types of medical related data. While still in BETA development Zylo is representing a great leap toward automated medical interactions. (NOTE: Sociloc takes the prevention of biased algorithms very seriously, and while sometimes inevetible, before utilizing our model please look through the data which we are using)
